# Technology Stack

## Current State
- No specific technology stack has been established yet
- Empty package.json indicates preparation for Node.js/JavaScript ecosystem
- Project structure suggests web application development

## Recommended Stack (To Be Determined)
Based on the directory structure, this project appears to be set up for:
- Frontend web application (indicated by `src/public/` directory)
- Node.js ecosystem (empty package.json present)

## Build System
- No build system currently configured
- Package.json is empty and needs to be populated with dependencies and scripts

## Common Commands
Once the tech stack is established, typical commands will likely include:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Development Setup
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Initialize package.json with appropriate dependencies
- Set up build tooling (Vite, Webpack, or similar)
- Configure development and production environments
